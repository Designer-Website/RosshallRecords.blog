            <h2>Cash for kids: Mission Christmas</h2>
            <p>Cash for Kids is a charity which gives grants to vulnerable children across the UK who need it. Cash for kids work with other organisations to provide support, hot meals and warm clothes to these families. They believe that ‘all children should be able to express their individuality, achieve their potential and live life to the full.’ </p>
            <p>In 2019, Cash for Kids raised around £20 million and supported over 1 million families and children. 2020 has changed everything. As families unexpectedly face poverty, more and more children could be waking up on Christmas Day without anything under the tree. Donate to Cash for kids: Mission Christmas to save Christmas for many kids</p>

                <h2>You can be a Santa</h2>
                <p>1 in  3 children go to bed without a hot meal, can’t afford warm clothes and are living in homes without heating. From 2018 to 2019 30% of children were living in poverty. Meaning 4.2 million children living without things we take for granted.</p>
                <p>These kids have gone through more than any child should. They suffer a fate which they did not bring on themselves. They endure the pain of the consequences of other people’s actions/ Why should they miss out making childhood memories? Why should they suffer?</p>
                <p>Christmas is a magical period, it changes us, makes us kinder to one another. Donate to this noble cause in the magical spirit of Christmas. Be a ‘Secret Santa’ and help many children create those magical memories with their families.</p>

            <h1>Give them hope</h1>
            <p>Hope is a powerful thing. These kids go through tough lives, they endure so much. They need help from others. They need hope of a better future that they can strive to achieve. Christmas is magical, it brings out the good in all of us. When you donate to these kids, it shows them that people care, that their lives matter and that’s enough to fuel their hope of a better future. Donate now. Show them that they are not alone, show them that they matter. Show them the magic of Christmas!</p>
